## Description
This data science course covers algorithms from [supervised learning](https://github.com/yw110-1/INDE-577/tree/main/Supervised%20Learning), [unsupervised learning](https://github.com/yw110-1/INDE-577/tree/main/Unsupervised%20Learning) , and reinforcement learning. Topics include:
### Supervised Learning:
- [Perceptron](https://github.com/yw110-1/INDE-577/tree/main/Supervised%20Learning/Perceptron)
- [Gradient Descent](https://github.com/yw110-1/INDE-577/tree/main/Supervised%20Learning/Gradient%20Descent)
- [Linear Regression](https://github.com/yw110-1/INDE-577/tree/main/Supervised%20Learning/Linear%20Regression)
- [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/yw110-1/INDE-577/tree/main/Supervised%20Learning/Logistic%20Regression)
- [Deep Neural Network](https://github.com/yw110-1/INDE-577/tree/main/Supervised%20Learning/Deep%20Neural%20Network)
- [k-Nearest Neighbors](https://github.com/yw110-1/INDE-577/tree/main/Supervised%20Learning/k-Nearest%20Neighbors)
- [Decision Trees](https://github.com/yw110-1/INDE-577/tree/main/Supervised%20Learning/Decision%20Tree)
- [Ensemble Learning](https://github.com/yw110-1/INDE-577/tree/main/Supervised%20Learning/Ensemble%20Learning)

### Unsupervised Learning:
- [k-Means Clustering](https://github.com/yw110-1/INDE-577/tree/main/Unsupervised%20Learning/k-Means%20Clustering)
- [Principle Component Analysis](https://github.com/yw110-1/INDE-577/tree/main/Unsupervised%20Learning/Principle%20Component%20Analysis)

For each sub-repository, I will include a README.md file that clearly explaining the algorithm being implemented as well as explaining the data that it is being used, and a .ipynb jupyter notebook with code for each model and method with performance and error analysis.

## Coding Tools:
- Python 3.8.15
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Visual Studio Code
- Google Colab
