# k-Means Clustering
In this sub-repository I will introduce the k-Means Clustering. 

## Algorithm
- The way k-means algorithm works is as follows:
  - Specify number of clusters K.
  - Initialize centroids by first shuffling the dataset and then randomly selecting K data points for the centroids without replacement.
  - Keep iterating until there is no change to the centroids. i.e assignment of data points to clusters isnâ€™t changing.
  - Compute the sum of the squared distance between data points and all centroids.
  - Assign each data point to the closest cluster (centroid).
  - Compute the centroids for the clusters by taking the average of the all data points that belong to each cluster.

## Dataset
The dataset I am using is [make_classification](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.make_classification.html) dataset.
