# Gradient Descent
In this sub-repository we will introduce a general continuous optimization technique called gradient descent.

## Algorithm
Gradient Descent is an iterative first-order optimization algorithm used to find a local minimum/maximum of a given function. This method is commonly used in machine learning and deep learning to minimise a cost/loss function (e.g. in a linear regression).
