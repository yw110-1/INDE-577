# Supervised Learning
Supervised learning, also known as supervised machine learning, is a subcategory of machine learning and artificial intelligence. It is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms that to classify data or predict outcomes accurately. As input data is fed into the model, it adjusts its weights until the model has been fitted appropriately, which occurs as part of the cross validation process. Supervised learning helps organizations solve for a variety of real-world problems at scale, such as classifying spam in a separate folder from your inbox.

## How supervised learning works?
Supervised learning uses a training set to teach models to yield the desired output. This training dataset includes inputs and correct outputs, which allow the model to learn over time. The algorithm measures its accuracy through the loss function, adjusting until the error has been sufficiently minimized.

Supervised learning can be separated into two types of problems when data miningâ€”classification and regression:

- Classification uses an algorithm to accurately assign test data into specific categories. It recognizes specific entities within the dataset and attempts to draw some conclusions on how those entities should be labeled or defined. Classification algorithms from the repository are [Perceptron](https://github.com/yw110-1/INDE-577/tree/main/Supervised%20Learning/Perceptron), [Decision Trees](https://github.com/yw110-1/INDE-577/tree/main/Supervised%20Learning/Decision%20Tree), [k-Nearest Neighbors](https://github.com/yw110-1/INDE-577/tree/main/Supervised%20Learning/k-Nearest%20Neighbors), [Deep Neural Network](https://github.com/yw110-1/INDE-577/tree/main/Supervised%20Learning/Deep%20Neural%20Network) like multilayer perceptron, and [Ensemble Learning](https://github.com/yw110-1/INDE-577/tree/main/Supervised%20Learning/Ensemble%20Learning) including random forest.
- Regression is used to understand the relationship between dependent and independent variables. It is commonly used to make projections, such as for sales revenue for a given business. [Gradient Descent](https://github.com/yw110-1/INDE-577/tree/main/Supervised%20Learning/Gradient%20Descent), [Linear Regression](https://github.com/yw110-1/INDE-577/tree/main/Supervised%20Learning/Linear%20Regression), and [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/yw110-1/INDE-577/tree/main/Supervised%20Learning/Logistic%20Regression) are regression algorithms that will be included in the repository.
